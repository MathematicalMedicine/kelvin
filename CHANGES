Version 2.3.2
  27 Apr 2011
  Kelvin binary
    Reorganize signal and exit handlers to better support SGE qdel.

Version 2.3.1
  4 Feb 2011
  Kelvin binary:
    Fix for segfault in certain 2pt M-M LE analyses

Version 2.3.0
  27 Jan 2011
  Kelvin binary:
    Shared memory segment for debugging is disabled by default in all builds
  Front End: 
    KelvinFamily can write pre-MAKEPED format pedigree files
    Pedigree counts for case/control pedigrees uses a weighting algorithm
  Sequential Update:
    Multipoint updating interpolates BRs for missing positions

Version 2.2.0
  If physical positions appear in map file, they are now displayed in two-point PPL
    (trait-to-marker only) and multipoint PPL and MOD files (interpolated to trait
    positions from nearest markers).

Version 2.1.0
  07/30/2010
  First release of Kelvin front-end Perl script, which provides new functionality:
    1. Handling pre-MAKEPED pedigree files.
    2. Automatic pedigree counting (without a separate step).
    3. Automatic allele frequency estimation
    4. Epistasis analyses
  Kelvin binary:
    1. Automatic reduction of empty liability classes.
    2. Map file columns are identified by headers, rather than fixed order.
    3. Improved warnings, errors and sanity checking.
  Sequential updating:
    1. Linkage results can be used to provide prior probabilities for LD results.

Version 0.38.1
  06/15/2010 (Dprime,theta) values for LD analysis are changed. 
  The number of values increase from 141 to 271. 


Version 0.38.0
  Extensive changes to directive syntax, error, status and progress messages. Review documentation.

  12/28/2009 Kelvin Dynamic grid had imprinting problem for MP_QT in which dD parameter used Dd.
             This problem is fixed.

  08/26/2009 Kelvin Fixed grid has two changes
  1. Boosting ratio from 1.1 to 1.3.
  2. Stopping criterion changed with bigger maximum calls and stricter criterion,
     which allows a longer run and also leads to more run before ending.  

  Zero (or near-zero) frequency alleles are ignored 
  and a warning displayed. Script to count
  genotypically identical pedigrees now included.
  See PedCount.pl for further details on usage.
  Compiled polynomials now available for dynamic grid,
  names are homogenized, and include chromosome number.
  Configuration file directives completely changed,
  use convertconfig.pl to update earlier config files.
  Dynamic grid now default method.
  kelvin now actively constrains analysis parameters
  to values that permit known good results in reasonable
  timeframes.
  Output completely revised and reduced in volume.
  Case control (CC) directive replaces CF
  directive. Count file (CF) directive added to permit 
  any pedigree counting data to be represented and 
  processed. Revitalized KLOG and LOG directive. Fixed
  Student's T pdf values for x outside of -10 to 10.
  Unreferenced marker alleles are no longer stored so
  the marker allele frequency file (MK directive) does
  not need to be edited down to match the pedigree
  marker data file (DF directive). New PedCount data
  preprocessing script to generate count files for 
  collections of pedigrees and a whole lot more. 
  Numerous minor bugfixes. Continued major structural
  changes. D' of zero always included on LD analyses.
  Polynomial compilation works on all platforms.

  BR overflow due to sample size is handled in this release
  by rescaling. BR overflow for individual pedigree, which is
  much less likely, is not handled yet.

  Tests include verification of dynamic grid underpinnings
  against those of fixed grid, as well as polynomial
  compilation where possible.

Version 0.37.1
  Numerous bugfixes in LD handling and estimation in
  cases with different numbers of marker alleles. Now
  uses proper intervals and quadratic interpolation for
  distributions. AS directive handling of Inf fixed.
  Marker-to-marker estimation incorporated. Test suite
  reorganized and expanded. Optimization level 3 (-O3)
  works again and defaulted with corresponding speed-up.
  Sequential update (calc_updated_ppl) is in a transitional 
  state.

Version 0.37.0
  Dependencies upon the GNU Scientific Library have been
  eliminated.  Polynomial compilation is now reliable and 
  documented. Extremely large polynomials (larger than
  physical memory) can now be built using a solid-state
  drive as an extension to physical memory. The AS directive 
  is no longer order-sensitive. Default D-primes are
  enforced for integration (dkelvin). Numerous minor bugfixes.

Version 0.36.1
  Fixed X Chromosome LD bug. dkelvin now lightly merged into
  kelvin -- specify DK directive in configuration file
  to use dkelvin-style numeric integration. Position
  column re-added to 2pt BR output. Numerous minor bug
  fixes. Polynomial compilation works using dynamic
  libraries. Documentation improved but still in-progress.

Version 0.36.0
  Imprinting is now supported. Changes to enable use on
  older versions of 64-bit Solaris.

Verison 0.35.0
  Major polynomial evaluation performance improvement via
  multi-threading. Can use drop-in memory allocators as
  needed. Cleaned-up versioning and build dating. Replaced 
  loop detection with new algorithm for both marriage and 
  cosanguinous loops. Improved configuration file error
  handling. Adding extensive internal documentation.
  For kelvin only (not dkelvin): Adding user documentation and 
  a test-suite (in progress). Added both detailed and 
  streamlined (default) progress tracking and hid (by default)
  all of the diagnostic output. Standardized output file 
  naming and format as described in new documentation.
  Prototyping polynomial compilation for speed and ease of 
  workload distribution via BOINC etc. dkelvin will merge into 
  kelvin in a future release.

Version 0.34.2
  Status child no longer dies on SIGQUIT. Monitors utilization
  each cycle of poly statistics dump and bails if user CPU was
  less than 25% (thrashing). Poly statistics now accurately
  reflect nearly all memory usage. Parallel building for
  polynomial (mostly reducing memory management overhead) present 
  but inactive. xmission_matrix change merged into dkelvin.
  No more misleading non-options for kelvin. Centralized dry-
  run statistic reporting regardless of run type. Alleles can
  now be represented as character strings as well as numeric
  values. Issue warning if there are still loops in a pedigree.
  Changed avgLR precision in avghet.out to 6 places to right
  of decimal instead of 8.

Version 0.34.1a
  Numerous minor performance improvements. Fixed
  bug with orphaned status processes hanging about. Clean-up
  memory monitoring and reporting. Parallel evaluation for
  polynomial present but inactive.
  Sequential updating code modified to better handle file formats
  generated by various combinations of analysis options, and
  specifically the exponential notation generated since 0.32.4

Version 0.34.1
  Added polynomial scale option to PE directive to support smaller
  memory environments. Further clean-ups of polynomial code, with
  more dynamic diagnostics and performance improvements. Now seems
  to stay memory-flat when appropriate. Added fork to dump pmap 
  total of virtual memory every 30 seconds if available. Makefiles 
  cleaned-up.

Version 0.34.0
  Added SR directive to have the option to save intermediate results.
  Extensive clean-ups of polynomial code, including stricter memory
  management, extensive dynamic diagnostics and significant performance
  improvements.

Version 0.33.1
  Fixed genotype_elimination problem when we fix loop breaker genotype
  when there are more than 1 loop breaker, some combination might not 
  be possible

Version 0.33.0
  Added polynomial garbage collection after each nuclear family

Version 0.32.4
  Use 4^n xmission matrix instead of 3^n to improve the search of 
  cells during the flip of the parent phase through bit wise operations

Version 0.32.2 
  Undo the recursion unrolling for loop_child_multilocus_genotype, as
  it decreased the performance 

Version 0.32.1
  For sex averaged, make sure under polynomial, theta_female and 
  theta_male all point to the same theta_average
  Untangle the recursion call of loop_child_multilocus_genotype
  Clean up some function calls to reduce stack/heap
  Added some counters to reduce tmpLikelihood collection for the proband

Version 0.32.0
  For NULL, instead of calculate L(T, M1,M2), we do L(T)*L(M1,M2) as 
  trait and marker loci are indepdent under NULL. This approach speeds
  up multipoint calculation up to 50%
  Allow half typed genotypes
