Verison 0.34.3
  Added conditionalized dump of polynomial source parenting
  information in DOT format for digraph generation. Evaluation
  now multi-threaded. Uses drop-in memory allocator.

Version 0.34.2
  Status child no longer dies on SIGQUIT. Monitors utilization
  each cycle of poly statistics dump and bails if user CPU was
  less than 25% (thrashing). Poly statistics now accurately
  reflect nearly all memory usage. Parallel building for
  polynomial (mostly reducing memory management overhead) present 
  but inactive. xmission_matrix change merged into dkelvin.
  No more misleading non-options for kelvin. Centralized dry-
  run statistic reporting regardless of run type. Alleles can
  now be represented as character strings as well as numeric
  values. Issue warning if there are still loops in a pedigree.
  Changed avgLR precision in avghet.out to 6 places to right
  of decimal instead of 8.

Version 0.34.1a
  Numerous minor performance improvements. Fixed
  bug with orphaned status processes hanging about. Clean-up
  memory monitoring and reporting. Parallel evaluation for
  polynomial present but inactive.
  Sequential updating code modified to better handle file formats
  generated by various combinations of analysis options, and
  specifically the exponential notation generated since 0.32.4

Version 0.34.1
  Added polynomial scale option to PE directive to support smaller
  memory environments. Further clean-ups of polynomial code, with
  more dynamic diagnostics and performance improvements. Now seems
  to stay memory-flat when appropriate. Added fork to dump pmap 
  total of virtual memory every 30 seconds if available. Makefiles 
  cleaned-up.

Version 0.34.0
  Added SR directive to have the option to save intermediate results.
  Extensive clean-ups of polynomial code, including stricter memory
  management, extensive dynamic diagnostics and significant performance
  improvements.

Version 0.33.1
  Fixed genotype_elimination problem when we fix loop breaker genotype
  when there are more than 1 loop breaker, some combination might not 
  be possible

Version 0.33.0
  Added polynomial garbage collection after each nuclear family

Version 0.32.4
  Use 4^n xmission matrix instead of 3^n to improve the search of 
  cells during the flip of the parent phase through bit wise operations

Version 0.32.2 
  Undo the recursion unrolling for loop_child_multilocus_genotype, as
  it decreased the performance 

Version 0.32.1
  For sex averaged, make sure under polynomial, theta_female and 
  theta_male all point to the same theta_average
  Untangle the recursion call of loop_child_multilocus_genotype
  Clean up some function calls to reduce stack/heap
  Added some counters to reduce tmpLikelihood collection for the proband

Version 0.32.0
  For NULL, instead of calculate L(T, M1,M2), we do L(T)*L(M1,M2) as 
  trait and marker loci are indepdent under NULL. This approach speeds
  up multipoint calculation up to 50%
  Allow half typed genotypes

Version 0.0.31:
  Add loop handling 

Version 0.0.30:
  Add parental phase pattern consolidations to speed up likelihood calculation
  Fixed bugs with high number of alleles (>32)

Version 0.0.29:
  Merged polynomial changes 

Version 0.0.28:
  Fixed bugs in multipoint analysis (4pt or more)

Version 0.0.27:
  Added multi-allelic LD handling (two point only)
  Added T_MIN, T_MAX keywords to specify threshold ranges for CT

Version 0.0.26:
  Enhanced Kelvin to take long line input - max line length is no longer fixed 
  Fixed bug in X chromosome LD analysis

Verion 0.0.25:
  Added special procesing for Case Ctrl (SNP)

Version 0.0.24:
  Added truncated QT distributions
  Added debug flags in kelvin.conf 

Version 0.0.23:
  Memory usage on polynomial has been reduced
  Added Chi-Square distribution for quantitative trait analysis

Version 0.0.22:
  Added sex-specific analyses to both twopoint and multipoint
  Added X chromosome analysis capability
  Fixed multiple marriage bug
  Optimized transmission matrix implementation

Version 0.0.21:
  Merged changes to transmission matrix with polynomial implementation
  Added PPL-LD implementation
  Fixed QT and Combied Trait analysis. Dataset mean and SD are 
    required input now.
  Check for likelihood ratio overflow and underflow problem

Version 0.0.20:
  This version includes trait locus and trait threshold values, along with other
  changes to the input configuration file format.

see doc/ReadMe.conf for instructions on how to configure.
