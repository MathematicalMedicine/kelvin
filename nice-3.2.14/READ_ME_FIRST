I have made some changes to this distribution to get rid of "gotchas".

Specifically, I have disabled the "install" target in every Makefile. This is
because the 'nice' developers had a very not-nice habit of making it the
default target, AND defaulting to installing in /usr! (G-d only knows what
they were thinking with that call...)

The part Kelvin actually wants is 'nicelib'; you should be able to get away
with only compiling it. With all the installation targets disabled, it ends
up being the new default, so just running `make` should suffice.

Hope this helps!
