======================================================================
This is the NICE distributed search infrastructure distribution.  To
install, edit the Makefile to set SYSTYPE and DISTDIR appropriately,
then "make install".

You will have to edit niced.conf to configure the daemon on each
machine. Read the comments to set the appropriate configuration.

The most important configuration item is the selection of a parent
processor. The root daemon should specify "localhost" as its parent
node, while all other nodes should specify the root daemon name as the
parent node. If you have a cluster of machines on a local network, you
can set the root daemon as the parent of the gateway machine and use
the gateway machine's internal IP address as the parent of all the
other machines on the local network. Be sure to mark the gateway as a
"barrier" node in niced.conf to avoid trying to promote machines with
only local network addresses out into the outside world.

You should also set the cardinality of the system, which governs how
many new processes are started each time a request to run in parallel
is received by that processor.  If you have access to only a single
system, setting a cardinality value greater than 1 simulates multiple
CPUs, and can be useful for debugging your code. If you have SMP
machines, you should set the cardinality to number of CPUs.
