Version 0.32.3
  Untangle the recursion call of loop_phases
  Use 4^n xmission matrix instead of 3^n to improve the search of 
  cells during the flip of the parent phase through bit wise operations

Version 0.32.2 
  Undo the recursion unrolling for loop_child_multilocus_genotype, as
  it decreased the performance 

Version 0.32.1
  For sex averaged, make sure under polynomial, theta_female and 
  theta_male all point to the same theta_average
  Untangle the recursion call of loop_child_multilocus_genotype
  Clean up some function calls to reduce stack/heap
  Added some counters to reduce tmpLikelihood collection for the proband

Version 0.32.0
  For NULL, instead of calculate L(T, M1,M2), we do L(T)*L(M1,M2) as 
  trait and marker loci are indepdent under NULL. This approach speeds
  up multipoint calculation up to 50%
  Allow half typed genotypes

Version 0.0.31:
  Add loop handling 

Version 0.0.30:
  Add parental phase pattern consolidations to speed up likelihood calculation
  Fixed bugs with high number of alleles (>32)

Version 0.0.29:
  Merged polynomial changes 

Version 0.0.28:
  Fixed bugs in multipoint analysis (4pt or more)

Version 0.0.27:
  Added multi-allelic LD handling (two point only)
  Added T_MIN, T_MAX keywords to specify threshold ranges for CT

Version 0.0.26:
  Enhanced Kelvin to take long line input - max line length is no longer fixed 
  Fixed bug in X chromosome LD analysis

Verion 0.0.25:
  Added special procesing for Case Ctrl (SNP)

Version 0.0.24:
  Added truncated QT distributions
  Added debug flags in kelvin.conf 

Version 0.0.23:
  Memory usage on polynomial has been reduced
  Added Chi-Square distribution for quantitative trait analysis

Version 0.0.22:
  Added sex-specific analyses to both twopoint and multipoint
  Added X chromosome analysis capability
  Fixed multiple marriage bug
  Optimized transmission matrix implementation

Version 0.0.21:
  Merged changes to transmission matrix with polynomial implementation
  Added PPL-LD implementation
  Fixed QT and Combied Trait analysis. Dataset mean and SD are 
    required input now.
  Check for likelihood ratio overflow and underflow problem

Version 0.0.20:
  This version includes trait locus and trait threshold values, along with other
  changes to the input configuration file format.

see doc/ReadMe.conf for instructions on how to configure.
