This directory contains some third-party libraries that are needed to compile
older versions of Kelvin as stored in this repository under releases/.

cdflib is needed for Kelvin 0.0.15 and earlier. NICE is needed for kelvin
0.34.0 and earlier (it was removed from the Makefile in 0.34.1). When
attempting to build these versions of Kelvin, you'll want to build the
necessary support libs and then add -I and -L flags pointing to these
directories to the Makefile.

Hope this helps!
