Added a mechanism for defining the affected, unaffected and unknown
values for both DT and QT. See pedlib/model_options.h for
affectionStatus array. These default values can be overridden in the
configuration file using the OP directive.

Made the appropriate changes in pedlib. More precisely:

1. the use of ModelOptions->unknownTraitValue is no longer
supported. Instead, the code should refer to:
  ModelOptions->affectionStatus[AFFECTION_STATUS_UNKNOWN]
I noticed there are several other versions of unknownTraitValue (in
Trait, for example), which I am not clear on what they are used for,
if at all.

2. direct use of AFFECTION_STATUS_UNKNOWN, AFFECTION_STATUS_AFFECTED,
and AFFECTION_STATUS_UNAFFECTED should be discontinued. Instead, the
code should refer to:
  ModelOptions->affectionStatus[AFFECTION_STATUS_UNKNOWN]
  ModelOptions->affectionStatus[AFFECTION_STATUS_AFFECTED]
  ModelOptions->affectionStatus[AFFECTION_STATUS_UNAFFECTED]
which are double (for the DT case, ints are cast to double). I did
note a few places in read_pedigree.c where the constant value 0 is
used instead of AFFECTION_STATUS_UNKNOWN, and I corrected it where it
seemed obvious. But there are probably others and these must be
corrected or great chaos will result sometime in the future when the
bug is tickled. See, for example, line 260:
  if ((int) pPerson->ppTraitValue[i][j] != 0)
this will break when users set these values differently in the config
file (corrected, I think).

4. Not sure what MAX_NUM_AFFECTION_STATUS in locus.h is supposed to
do. It is defined, but only used to size the penetrance array in the
same file. This makes some sense for DT, but does it still make sense
for QT? And will it/could it ever be something other than 3?

======================================================================
Added parsing of AS directive (affection status values). Format is 

  AS unknown unaffected affected

======================================================================
Added parsing of T distribution. The T distribution parameter degrees
of freedom is stored in modelOptions->constants[0]. This is a new
array of ints that can be used to contain additional fixed
distribution parameters (or constants), like the degrees of freedom,
for distributions that might be added in the future. The ordering of
fixed distribution constants in the array is distribution-specific.

======================================================================
Modified/fixed parsing of multipoint directives, SS and SA, for
sex-specific and sex-averaged multipoint, respectively. These replace
the ambiguous MP directive (which also stands for map file).

======================================================================
Modified/fixed parsing of polynomial evaluation directive. The default is 
to perform explicit, not polynomial, evaluation; to change the default, use:

  PE

======================================================================
Added parsing of AL directive (alpha value). This establishes a
sorted, uniquified, independent value set in the range->alpha array.

  AL 0.1; 0.2; 0.3;
  AL 0.3 0.9 0.2

======================================================================
Added parsing of TL directive (trait locus). This establishes a
sorted, uniquified, independent value set in the range->tloc array for
use in walking the chromosome.

  TL 0 140 2

======================================================================
Added parsing of TT directive (trait threshold) and constraints on TT
values by liability class for CT only (in fact, this turns QT->CT,
gives error on DT)

  TT 0 1 0.1

has the usual meaning, and, when liability classes are active, you can
also say, for example:

  TT 1 >= TT 2

still to do: constraining the values of the trait thresholds based on
means for that liability class.
