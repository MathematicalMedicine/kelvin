**************
Current Issues:
1. performance problem
2. memory runs out for >4 markers w/polynomial (snps)
3. walking chromosome works but gets slower on each position

*********************
Near future Additions:
Write out lods.out file
sex specific LD for TP
Allele frequency estimation - MLE
loops
Allow imprinting
Lander green algorithm

*******************
Associated Programs:
seq_update needs to be updated to reflect the new output file

************************
Long shots (low priority):
covariates
allow >2 alleles for disease locus
allow >1 disease loci
