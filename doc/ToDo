**************
Bugs:
1. MarkerToMarker analyses crash when dataset contains no trait
2. FixedGrid analyses should exit when constraints leave no models
3. SexSpecific analyses should require male and female positions in map file.

**************
Current Issues:
1. Memory demand under polynomial mode
2. Multiple D' for dKelvin
3. QT t distribution parameters

*********************
Near future Additions:
1. Write out lods.out file
2. Allele frequency estimation - MLE
3. Lander green algorithm
4. For marker to marker analysis
   allow all pair wise within a window sized based on BP, cM, number of markers
5. Loopbreaker and proband selection for makeped replacement

************************
Long shots (low priority):
1. covariates
2. allow >2 alleles for disease locus
3. allow >1 disease loci
4. sex specific LD for TP
