**************
Current Issues:
1. Memory demand under polynomial mode
2. Multiple D' for dKelvin

*********************
Near future Additions:
1. Write out lods.out file
2. Allele frequency estimation - MLE
3. Lander green algorithm


************************
Long shots (low priority):
1. covariates
2. allow >2 alleles for disease locus
3. allow >1 disease loci
4. sex specific LD for TP
