**************
Current Issues:
1. performance problem
2. memory runs out for >4 markers w/polynomial (snps)
3. walking chromosome works but gets slower on each position

*********************
Near future Additions:
Differentiate different OS and include different h files for INFINITY 
  and NAN or get rid of these in the code
Write out lods.out file
sex specific for TP
sex specific for MP
sex linked chromosome analysis
Integrate marker allele frequencies instead of fixing them under LD
Allele frequency estimation - MLE
loops
Allow imprinting
Lander green algorithm

*******************
Associated Programs:
seq_update needs to be updated to reflect the new output file

************************
Long shots (low priority):
covariates
allow >2 alleles for disease locus
allow >1 disease loci
