If you are just getting started with kelvin, or are uncomfortable directly
editing a configuration file, you can use the _g_r_a_p_h_i_c_ _c_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_a_t_i_o_n_ _f_i_l_e_ _e_d_i_t_o_r

Kelvin's configuration file format is intended to be easy to read and edit.
Kelvin, in general, requires the user to explicitly specify what Kelvin is to
do, and doesn't make any assumptions about what the user may or may not want.
Kelvin will display helpful error messages and terminate if the configuration
file contains incompatible directives.

CCoonnffiigguurraattiioonn FFiillee FFoorrmmaatt

The kelvin configuration file is a text file containing directives that
describe the nature of the analysis to be performed, and the names of input and
output files. Directives typically appear on separate lines, but multiple
directives, separated by a semicolon (';'), may appear on the same line. Some
directives require arguments, which must appear on the same line as the
directive they modify. Blank lines in the configuration file are ignored. Extra
white space (spaces and tabs) around directives and arguments is ignored.
Comments may be embedded in a configuration file with a pound sign ('#'). The
pound sign and any text, up to the end of the line, will be ignored. Comments
may appear on a line by themselves, or at the end of a line that also contains
a directive(s). In the latter case, a semicolon is not required to separate the
directive and the comment.

DDiirreeccttiivveess

Directives are words or combinations of words with no intervening spaces. This
document will capitalize the individual words that make up a directive (for
example, MapFile), but they may appear in the configuration file with any
capitalization (Mapfile, mapfile, MAPFILE, etc.). Also, directives may be
abbreviated, so long as the abbreviation is unique. For example, MapFile could
be abbreviated to Map. SexLinked could be abbreviated to SexL, but not to Sex,
since that could also be an abbreviation for SexSpecific.

AArrgguummeennttss

Most directives require one or more arguments, which will take one of the
following forms:

* A Filename - a character string that must be a valid filename, optionally
  including a relative or absolute path preceding the filename. Generally,
  Kelvin will abort if a file given as input does not exist, and will overwrite
  a file given for output if it does exist. The total length of a filename may
  not exceed 256 characters.
* A Literal String - a few directives require a specific string as an argument.
  These strings may appear with any capitalization, but they should not be
  abbreviated.
* A Value - an integer or real number, depending on the directive.
* A Range - a shorthand method for specifiying a series of values with a
  regular interval. A range is specified as a start value, a literal '-', an
  end value, a literal ':', and an increment. Start, end and increment values
  may be integers or real numbers. Start and end values may be positive or
  negative, with the restriction that the end must be no less than the start.
  The increment must be a positive value. Intervening whitespace may be added
  for clarity, but is not necessary. Kelvin will expand the range into a list
  of values that begins with the start value, increases by the increment, and
  ends with the last value that is no greater than the end value. For example,
  a range that runs from -1 to 1 in increments of 0.1 would be specified as '-
  1 - 1 : 0.1'. A range specified as '0-1:0.15' would expand to 0, 0.15 ...
  0.75, 0.90.

Kelvin configuration files can be quite simple. Here's a file for a multipoint
analysis that will generate PPLs for a dichotomous trait at one centiMorgan
intervals, considering 4 markers around each trait position:

 1 # Sample multipoint, dictomous trait configuration
 2
 3 MultiPoint 4
 4 TraitPositions 0-end:1
 5
 6 PhenoCodes 0, 1, 2
 7
 8 PedigreeFile ped.post
 9 LocusFile locus.dat
10 MapFile map.dat
11 FrequencyFile freq.dat
12 BayesRatioFile br.out
13 PPLFile ppl.out

Lines 3 and 4 specify a 4-marker multipoint analysis, and that the trait should
be placed at 1 cM intervals, starting at 0 cM and running through the end of
the map. Line 6 specifies the values that will appear in the affection status
column in the pedigree file. Lines 8-13 specify input and output files.
Here's a file for two-point analysis that will generate PPLs and linkage
disequilibrium statistics between a dichotomous trait and each marker in the
dataset:

 1 # Sample two-point, dictomous trait LD configuration
 2
 3 LD
 4
 5 PhenoCodes 0, 1, 2
 6
 7 PedigreeFile ped.post
 8 LocusFile locus.dat
 9 MapFile map.dat
10 FrequencyFile freq.dat
11 BayesRatioFile br.out
12 PPLFile ppl.out
13 MODFile mod.out
14 ExtraMODs

Two-point analysis is the default, so no directive is necessary to specify
that. Line 3 specifies a linkage disequilibrium analysis. Line 5 specifies the
values that will appear in the affection status field of the pedigree. Lines 7-
13 specify input and output files. Line 14 specifies that additional
information should be written to the MOD file specified on line 13.

In this reference, the following convetions are used to describe the valid
arguments to directives.

* Arguments that appear in roman type are literals. If they are to be used in
  the configuration file, they must appear as written in this reference. For
  example,

    QT ChiSq

  indicates that the literal string ChiSq is a legal argument to the QT
  directive.
* Arguments that appear in italic type are symbolic, and refer to one of the
  four types of _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s, described above. If they are to be used in the
  configuration file, they must conform to the description of the respective
  argument type. For example,

    PedigreeFile filename

  indicates that the PedigreeFile directive requires a single argument that
  conforms to the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e type.
* A group of arguments inside brackets, separated by vertical bars, indicates a
  choice between multiple possible arguments, of which exactly one must be
  chosen. The individual options will either be literal or symbolic. For
  example,

    MarkerToMarker [ All | Adjacent ]

  indicates that the MarkerToMarker directive can take either of the literals
  All or Adjacent as arguments.
* Arguments that appear inside braces are optional, but will otherwise be
  literal, symbolic or a group of arguments, as described above. Braces
  containing an ellipsis means that whatever came immediately before the
  ellipsis may be optionally repeated one or more times. For example,

    QTT Normal { mean, standarddeviation }

  indicates that the QTT directive with the Normal argument optionally accepts
  two additional arguments, mean and standarddeviation. In this example,

    TraitPositions [ Marker | value | range ] {, ... }

  the TraitPositions directive can take either a literal Marker, a single value
  or a range, and furthermore can take one or more of any of the preceding,
  after a separating comma.

BBaayyeessRRaattiiooFFiillee

DDiisseeaasseeAAlllleelleess
DiseaseAlleles number
Specifies the number of alleles for the hypothetical trait locus. Currently the
only supported number of disease alleles is 2, which also the default. This
directive is incompatible with the _M_a_r_k_e_r_T_o_M_a_r_k_e_r directive.
DDrryyRRuunn

Specifies that configuration and input data should be read and validated, and
that the complexity of the analysis should be estimated, but no calculations
are performed.
EEppiissttaassiiss
Epistasis markername
Specifies that Kelvin should consider epistasis between the trait and the
marker identified by markername. Marker genotype data for the selected marker
must be provided using the _E_p_i_s_t_a_s_i_s_P_e_d_i_g_r_e_e_F_i_l_e and _E_p_i_s_t_a_s_i_s_L_o_c_u_s_F_i_l_e
directives. If the marker also appears in the dataset to be analyzed, it will
be dropped. This directive is incompatible with the _L_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_y_C_l_a_s_s_e_s directive.

EpistasisPedigreeFile filename
Specifies the pedigree file that contains genotype data for the marker
specified with the _E_p_i_s_t_a_s_i_s directive. This can be a pedigree file from
another dataset (another chromosome, for example), or it can be the same file
specified the the _P_e_d_i_g_r_e_e_F_i_l_e directive. This directive requires the _E_p_i_s_t_a_s_i_s
and _E_p_i_s_t_a_s_i_s_L_o_c_u_s_F_i_l_e directives, and is incompatible with the

from a another dataset (another chromosome, for example), or it can be the same
file specified with the _L_o_c_u_s_F_i_l_e directive. This directive requires the
_E_p_i_s_t_a_s_i_s and _E_p_i_s_t_a_s_i_s_P_e_d_i_g_r_e_e_F_i_l_e directives, and is incompatible with the

Specifes that additional data should be written to the file specified by the
_M_O_D_F_i_l_e directive. For _t_w_o_-_p_o_i_n_t analyses, an extra line containing MOD
information where Theta is 0 will be written, and for _L_D analyses, another line
containing MOD information where D' is 0 will be written. This directive is
incompatible with the _M_u_l_t_i_p_o_i_n_t directive.
FFrreeqquueennccyyFFiillee
FrequencyFile filename
Specifies the name of the input file from which marker allele frequencies will
be read. Defaults to markers.dat if not specified.
IImmpprriinnttiinngg
Imprinting
Specifies that imprinting, or parent-of-origin, effects on the trait should be
considered. This directive is incompatiable with the _M_a_r_k_e_r_T_o_M_a_r_k_e_r directive.
LLDD
LD
Specifies that linkage disequilibrium statistics should be calculated. This
directive is incompatible with the _M_u_l_t_i_P_o_i_n_t and _S_e_x_S_p_e_c_i_f_i_c directives.
LLiiaabbiilliittyyCCllaasssssseess
LiabilityClasses number
Specifies that individuals in the pedigrees have been categorized into two or
more classes. The penetrance values for individuals in one class will be
considered independently from the other class(es). Note that a column that
identifies the class for each individual must appear in the pedigree file.
Kelvin expects liability classes to be numbered contiguously, starting at 1. If
Kelvin detects that one or more of the specified classes is empty, it will drop
the empty classes, and consolidate the remaining classes. This directive is
incompatiable with the _M_a_r_k_e_r_T_o_M_a_r_k_e_r directive.
LLooccuussFFiillee
LocusFile filename
Specifies the name of the input file from which the pedigree column layout
information will be read. This file is sometimes referred to as a 'data file.'
Defaults to datafile.dat if not specified.
PPrrooggrreessssLLeevveell
ProgressLevel number
Specifies the level of detail of progress information that Kelvin should
generate while it runs:

* 0, steps only, such as start and end of analysis
* 1, substeps, such as progress thru trait loci
* 2 thru 8, increasing levels of detail, such as polynomial build or evaluation

The default is 1. Use this in conjunction with the _P_r_o_g_r_e_s_s_D_e_l_a_y_S_e_c_o_n_d_s
directive to fine-tune the flow of progress information to suit your needs.
PPrrooggrreessssDDeellaayySSeeccoonnddss
ProgressDelaySeconds number
Specifies the delay between progress notifications displayed by Kelvin. The
intent of this directive is to stabilize the frequency of progress
notifications and hence the overall volume of progress information. The default
value is 120 seconds. This causes only the most recent progress notifications
permitted by the _P_r_o_g_r_e_s_s_L_e_v_e_l_s directive to be displayed every two minutes.
For example, if 32 pedigrees have been processed in the last two minutes, only
the notification of the start of processing of the 33rd will be displayed. Note
that this can cause progress messages to be delayed. If, in our example, the
33rd pedigree is start processing 2 seconds into the 120 second delay interval,
the message displayed at the end of the interval will be 118 seconds old.
If you require an earlier progress update, press CTRL/\.
If no fresh progress notifications are available, ...running... will be
displayed.
Specifying 0 (zero) causes Kelvin to display all permitted levels of progress
messages as they occur.
MMaappFFiillee
MapFile filename
Specifies the name of the input file from which the marker map data will be
read. Defaults to mapfile.dat if not specified.
MMaarrkkeerrTTooMMaarrkkeerr
MarkerToMarker [ All | Adjacent ]
Specifies that only the relationships of pairs of markers should be considered,
and that no trait is included in the analisys. Under linkage equilibrium, the
intermarker distance is estimated. Under _l_i_n_k_a_g_e_ _d_i_s_e_q_u_i_l_i_b_r_i_u_m, the degree of
linkage disequilibrium between the markers is estimated. If All is specified,
all possible pairs of markers in the dataset are considered. If Adjacent is
specified, only adjacent pairs of markers are considered.
MMOODDFFiillee
MODFile filename
Specifies the name of the output file to which maximizing model information
will be written. This directive is incompatible with the _M_u_l_t_i_P_o_i_n_t directive.
MMuullttiiPPooiinntt
MultiPoint count
Specifies that Kelvin should perform a multipoint analysis, generating a
multipoint PPL for each location specified with the _T_r_a_i_t_P_o_s_i_t_i_o_n_s directive.
Groups of count adjacent markers, centered on each trait location, will be used
to calculate the PPL. This directive is incompatible with the _M_a_r_k_e_r_T_o_M_a_r_k_e_r
and _L_D directives.
NNoonnPPoollyynnoommiiaall
NonPolynomial
Specifies that Kelvin should not internally represent the likelihood
caclulation as a polynomial. This option will dramatically reduce memory
requirements, but can increase run time by orders of magnitude for complex
analyses. This directive is incompatible with the _P_o_l_y_n_o_m_i_a_l_S_c_a_l_e directive.
PPeeddiiggrreeeeFFiillee
PedigreeFile filename
Specifies the name of the input file from which the pedigree data will be read.
Defaults to pedfile.dat if not specified.
PPhheennooCCooddeess
PhenoCodes unknown
PhenoCodes unknown, unaffected, affected
Specifies the values that will appear in the affection status (phenotype) field
of the pedigree file, to indicate if an individual is affected, unaffected, or
if the affection status is unknown. For quantitative trait analyses, only the
value for unknown affection status should be specified. For dichotomous traits,
the defaults are 0 (for unknown), 1 (for unaffected) and 2 (for affected). For
quantitative threshold traits, the defaults are -99.99, -88.88 and 88.88. For
quantitative traits, the default is -99.99 (for unknown). This directive is
incompatible with the _M_a_r_k_e_r_T_o_M_a_r_k_e_r directive.
PPoollyynnoommiiaallSSccaallee
PolynomialScale scale
If the user knows in advance that an analysis will require large amounts of
memory, this directive can be specified, and Kelvin will pre-allocate memory
before it begins calculations. This will result in somewhat more efficient use
of memory, compared to Kelvin incrementally allocating memory as it runs. The
scale is an integer between 1 and 10. This directive is incompatible with the
_N_o_n_P_o_l_y_n_o_m_i_a_l directive.
PPPPLLFFiillee
PPLFile filename
For two-point analyses, specifies the name of the output file to which PPLs
will be written. For multipoint analyses, PPLs are written to the file
specified by the _B_a_y_e_s_R_a_t_i_o_F_i_l_e directive, and no data will written to the file
specified with this directive. Defaults to ppl.out if not specified.
QQTT
QT Normal { mean, standarddeviation }
QT ChiSq
Specifies that the trait is quantitative, rather than dichotomous. The trait
data in the pedigree file should be of a quantitative nature (values on a
continuous scale, rather than discrete affected or unaffected values). Two
distributions are available, Normal and Chi-squared. If Normal is specified,
the sample mean and standarddeviation _v_a_l_u_e_s may be provided. Otherwise, a
sample mean and standard deviation will be calculated using the trait values in
the pedigree file. This directive is incompatible with the _M_a_r_k_e_r_T_o_M_a_r_k_e_r
directive.
QQTTTT
QTT Normal { mean, standarddeviation }
QTT ChiSq
Like the _Q_T directive, but in addition considers a threshold beyond which an
individual as simply assumed to be affected. The minimum and maximum threshold
may specified with the _T_h_r_e_s_h_o_l_d directive, but that is not required. This
directive in incompatible with the _M_a_r_k_e_r_T_o_M_a_r_k_e_r directive.
SSeexxLLiinnkkeedd
SexLinked
Specifies that the pedigree contains data for the X chromosome.
SSeexxSSppeecciiffiicc
SexSpecific
Specifies that the _m_a_p_ _f_i_l_e contains sex-specific centiMorgan positions for the
markers, and that the sex-specific positions should be used instead of sex-
averaged positions during the analysis. Requires that the map file actually
contains sex-specific positions. This directive is incompatible with the _L_D
directive.
TThhrreesshhoolldd
Threshold min, max
Specifies the minimum and maximum _v_a_l_u_e_s for the threshold for use with the _Q_T_T
directive, if needed. The default is for the minimum and maximum threshold
values to be set using the smallest and largest values from the trait data in
the pedigree file. If those values are less than 0 or greater than 30, then
this directive must be specified. The min and max should be _v_a_l_u_e_s. This
directive requires the _Q_T_T directive.

TraitPositions [ Marker | value | range ] {, ... }
Specifies the positions at which PPLs will be calculated in a multipoint
analysis. The literal string Marker indicates that PPLs should be calculated at
each marker position, in addition to any other positions. If a _r_a_n_g_e is
specified, the end value of the range may be specified as the literal end. In
that case, Kelvin will expand the range so the last value is just past the last
marker in the map. The literal end in a range specification is only valid with
this directive. This directive requires the _M_u_l_t_i_P_o_i_n_t directive.

Kelvin can be configured to perform calculations based on fixed grids of
parameter values. This option should be used with extreme caution for purposes
of computing PPLs because it is not compatible with Kelvin's underlying
numerical integration routines and can return erroneous BRs. However, it can be
useful in cases where, for instance, a very fine grid of values is wanted for
purposes of increasing precision of the MOD and/or maximizing values, or for
calculation of fixed-model LODs. It can also be configured to reproduce the
"fixed-grid" numerical integration routines used by older versions of Kelvin
for purposes of comparison with results generated under those versions. The
_F_i_x_e_d_M_o_d_e_l_s directive enables this behavior, and is required for any advanced
directives that fix points of the trait model.

_d_i_r_e_c_t_i_v_e_s to be constrained based on trait genotype or liability class. For
example, the trait penetrances might be constrained such that the penetrance
given a single copy of the disease gene is always less than or equal to the
penetrance given two copies of the disease gene. For constraints based solely
on trait genotypes (no liability class is specified), the genotypes should be
different. Constraints involving a liability class require that the
_L_i_a_b_i_l_i_t_y_C_l_a_s_s directive. Constraints on a given dimension of the trait model
(_P_e_n_e_t_r_a_n_c_e, _M_e_a_n, _S_t_a_n_d_a_r_d_D_e_v, _D_e_g_r_e_e_s_O_f_F_r_e_e_d_o_m, _T_h_r_e_s_h_o_l_d) require that the
respective directive be specified, with all the requirements those directives
imply. Multiple constraints on the same dimension may appear, separated by a
comma, on the same line. In this case, if either of conditions is true, the
constraint is satisfied. Constraints that appear on separate lines will all be
enforced. This directive requires _F_i_x_e_d_M_o_d_e_l_s.

CountFile filename
Specifies the name of the input file from which pedigree count information will
be read. The default is that pedigrees are not counted. Pedigree counting can
dramatically improve efficiency by skipping redundant calculations when
multiple families have the exact same structure, genotypes and affection
status. This makes it very useful for case/control, trio or affected sib-pair
analyses.
