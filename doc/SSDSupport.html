<h1>Solid-State Drive Support</h1>
<h2>Why use a Solid-State Drive (SSD)?</h2>
We are currently using
SSDs as an interim solution to problems with K<font size="-1">ELVIN</font> running out of memory when building
likelihood polynomials for certain pedigrees. We have added support for storing selected portions of polynomials
on high-speed disk (typically SSDs) during the build process. This reduces physical memory requirements
by anywhere from 40-90%, and allows us to limit the impact on performance by be very selective in when and 
how a storage mechanism slower than 
physical memory is used. One might ask why we simple didn't replace our swap drive with an SSD to facilitate
using virtual memory beyond physical memory limitations. The short answer is we did, and it didn't help a 
bit because of locality issues that could not be simply addressed.

<h2>How to Use SSD Support</h2>
Currently SSD support is built into custom versions of K<font size="-1">ELVIN</font> that have been built with
the USE_SSD compilation flag. Since storing portions of the polynomial on an SSD will very adversely affect
performance regardless of how clever we are in our optimizations, it is recommended that SSD support only be used
to generate code for polynomials -- not for their evaluation. Both code generation and evaluation traverse all
components of a polynomial, which require reading all portions stored on the SSD, so if we can do that only once,
we should.

In this release of K<font size="-1">ELVIN</font>, SSD support is built-into binaries when the <tt>USE_SSD</tt>
compilation flag is specified. Two are provided by default, <tt>kelvin-POLYCOMP_DL-FAKEEVALUATE-SSD</tt>, which
