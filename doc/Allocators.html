<h3>Why Use a Replacement Allocator?</h3>
There are two good reasons to use a replacement allocator -- runtime performance improvement and better control of
memory utilization. In either case, the presumption is that the default allocator provided by your runtime
environment is suboptimal for your application. We have found this to be the case for kelvin under Redhat 
Linux, but not so much under Darwin.
<p>
For most applications, runtime performance improvement is the primary motivation for using a replacement
allocator, but with
polynomial's unquenchable thirst for memory, good memory utilizaiton control is critical. This is especially true when
running with multiple execution threads, as each thread has its own memory allocation arena, and
poor management can waste large amounts of memory. Simply put, if it weren't for drop-in allocators,
we would not use OpenMP with polynomial evaluation in kelvin, because our primary constrait is always memory. Any 
runtime performance improvement we happen to get is just gravy.

<h3>Using Replacement Allocators</h3>
There are two ways of incorporating replacement memory allocators -- linking or preloading. Linking is the
more reliable but cumbersome approach. It eliminates the possibility of accidently running without the
allocator by incorrectly defining the preload environment variable, but one must edit the
Makefile and rebuild the kelvin binaries to include or exclude the allocator. Preloading is easy
to enable and disable, as it does not require rebuilding, but since there is no obvious indication of 
whether the allocator is preloaded, 
one can spend a lot of time doing performance testing of an allocator only to discover it wasn't there. Guess
why I know that.

<h4>Preloading</h4>

Under most un*x OSes, the environment variable LD_PRELOAD must point to the drop-in
allocator. Under Darwin, the environment variable is DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES.
<p>
Our experience with hoard has indicated that you only want to have it preloaded when
you're running kelvin. If you inadvertently leave it loaded with other programs, their behavior can be erratic.
