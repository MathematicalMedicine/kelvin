1. add validity checking on combinations of features in the config file

2. constrain trait thresholds between min mean and the max mean per
liability class

3. add parsing of DP (for dprime) parameter values for LD/2P/DT (error
for CT/QT and MP). dprime describes the probability that 2 alleles
(one from trait, one from marker) occur together, so we'll need
(nalleles-1)*(ntraitvals-1) combinations (should these add to 1?)

   constraints?
   expansion?

-1 to 1, subject to liability class, subject constraints across
liability classs.
