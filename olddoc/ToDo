**************
Bugs:
1. MarkerToMarker analyses crash when dataset contains no trait
2. FixedGrid analyses should exit when constraints leave no models
3. SexSpecific analyses should require male and female positions in map file.

****************
Need to add:
Add directives for truncated QT analyses. Two parameters allowed:
  minQT - floor of QT
  maxQT - ceiling of QT 
  Presence of either or both parameters indicates truncated QT
Test truncated QT 
Test QT chisq and truncated QT with likelihood server
Add polynomial with likelihood server

*********************
Near future Additions:
1. Write out lods.out file
2. Allele frequency estimation - MLE
3. Lander green algorithm
4. For marker to marker analysis
   allow all pair wise within a window sized based on BP, cM, number of markers
5. In post-makeped pedigree files, individuals with the proband column -1 are probands and also loopbreaker. Currently Kelvin doesn't handle that 
6. Currently when there are loopbreakers, Kelvin demands post-makeped ped
   file. We could implement in such way that default loopbreakers are selected
   based on pre-makeped, or users can input loopbreaker file in conjunction
   with pre-makeped file
   

************************
Long shots (low priority):
. Memory demand under polynomial mode
. Multiple D' for dKelvin
. covariates
. allow >2 alleles for disease locus
. allow >1 disease loci
. sex specific LD for TP
