0. why are penets floats while theta and gfreqs are double?

1. thetas are odd: looks like RADSMM only supports a single theta
vector in two modes (grid or vector) rather than truly separate
male/female thetas (two distinct theta vectors).

1. doesn't handle combined models (Q+D).
2. doesn't handle multiallelic diseases.
