1. performance problem
2. memory runs out for >4 markers w/polynomial (snps)
3. walking chromosome works but gets slower on each position

*Separate output file for average 
*For 2PT, allow multiple markers and go through them one by one
*Incorporate Dprime
*Allow just marker to marker analysis & output R square for SNPs
sex specific for TP
sex specific for MP
sex linked chromosome analysis
Integrate marker allele frequencies instead of fixing them under LD
Allele frequency estimation - MLE
loops
Allow imprinting
Lander green algorithm

Long shots (low priority)
covariates
allow >2 alleles for disease locus
allow >1 disease loci
