Alberto,
    I've attached the FlankPick code. It is also available on forkhead at
/home/mmilder/code/nflank/FlankPick.c
    I've also attached a sample input and output for FlankPick.

    The Following is an excerpt from the /home/mmilder/code/nflank/doc

------------------------------------------------------------------

Method code

consists of 3 numbers seperated by a single space

First number of the number of flanking pairs of markers.
  How many pairs of marker to each side of the Point of Interest to use.
Note: you must double this number to determine the actually number of
markers that will be used. 0 to 9 is allowed.

Second number is the midpoint flag.
   if 1 then will add one more marker. Will be the first "free" marker to the
left or right depending on the if the PoI is closest to a marker on the right
or the left.

The Third number is currently not implimented.
   It will be for selecting markers based on closeness. You can 1 to 9 addition
markers based on which markers are the closest unused (i.e. not already picked
for flanking for

When on the ends, the rules change. The program will preserve the number of
markers at all costs.


Nflank internally calls a program called FlankPick. nflank can not run without
FlankPick, It is the brains of nflank. FlankPick should not be called directly
by the user. It reads from STDIN and writes to STDOUT.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FlankPick
   Reads from STDIN, writes to STDout

Inputs.
   Method code. (Even #, Midpt flag, Closest # ) (see above)
   Step size,  Starting offset, ending offset.
   (K)osambi or (H)aldane
   List of markers with distances in centimorgans
   -1 <EOF>


Output
1 line per vitesse run.
Fields in each line are delimited by a '|'. The fields are...
   1     location or "O" if offmap is needed
   2     markermap, The ordering of the markers.
   3     theta list
   4     Vitesse "foo" value (second value on final line in datafile.dat)
   5     A list of indexes of the markers to use.


nflank directs FlankPick to read from a file named '.temp_dist_input'
and write to a file named '.temp_dist_output'. These files are not deleted
by nflank but the user can delete them after nflank has finished.
