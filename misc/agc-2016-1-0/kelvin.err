PID: 4795, kelvin V0.34.0.1, likelihood V0.32.4, locus V0.32.4, polynomial V0.0.32.4 starting run
To force a dump of stats, type CTRL-\ (dangerous and terse but always works)
or type "kill -10 4795" (safe and thorough, but requires program cooperation).
!!!!!!!!!!!The Computation is done in polynomial mode!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
